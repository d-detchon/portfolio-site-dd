                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p><i>Why, for you, is design all about relationships?</i>
                    The designer is always in relationship with the user! And vice versa. But it’s the
                    designer’s job to consider what it’s like to use their product. The designer has
                    questions like, how was that for you? Did it work how you expected it to? Were
                    you able to do what you intended?
                    And when the user tests the product, the designer gets to learn what kind of
                    relationship emerges: between the user and the product. Does this thing stress
                    you out? Or does it “spark joy?”</p>
                <p><i>Where are you based?</i>
                    I’m currently in Boulder, and have been in Colorado for 16 years. I grew up in
                    Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
                <p><i>How do you spend your free time?</i>
                    My main activity outside of work is practicing and hosting Zen programs with an
                    incredible local community. The practice is centered on meditation and cultivating
                    attentional skills. I feel an immediate connection with others who are drawn to
                    stillness and silence. Sangha often gives me the opportunity to cook for a group of
                    people, which has become a real passion for me. You can also find me swimming
                    laps with Masters, or drawing in my sketchbook at the Grown Ups Table.</p>
                <p><i>What’s a fun fact about you?</i>
                    I’m a twin! This has always been my “fun fact.” Besides the omg factor that usually
                    comes with this fact, I say it because this relationship has shaped my life since
                    Day 1. Maybe that’s also why I tend to focus on relationships so much.</p>
                <p><i>What’s your professional experience?</i>
                    I currently work as a Program Manager for the Boulder Zen Center. This position at
                    a small non-profit combines administration, marketing, visual design, and
                    customer support. Previously, I worked at a top-quality frame shop as a custom
                    frame fitter. Before that, I co-led the rebrand and launch of a small lodging
                    business called the Boulder Guest House. In all of these positions, I’ve honed my
                    skills in responding to business needs and customer expectations. My style, both
                    personally and professionally, is to be sincere, straightforward, and solution-
                    focused. And to make room for beauty.</p>
